  topx <- x$name[1:top]

```{r}

get_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = "F") |>
  plot_top(babynames, select_sex = "F", top = 10)
```
```{r}
#| label: fig-M
get_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = "M") |>
  plot_top(babynames, select_sex = "M", top = 10)
```

We can see many things in @fig-F as well as @fig-M
